# Hi there, I’m Angel! 👋

### 🚀 About Me

I'm Angel Fernandes – a curious coder, data wrangler, and full-stack explorer with a background that mixes **Computer Science** 💻 with **Business Information & Analytics** 📊.

Whether it's building smart pipelines, modeling real-world chaos with AI, or making frontends friendlier, I'm all about solving problems that *actually* matter. Bonus points if there's a dashboard involved.  

---

### 💼 The Highlights:

- 🔧 **Incoming Software Engineer** at **Charles Schwab**
- 🛠️ **Data Engineer Intern** @ USAA – turned chaos into clean Snowflake tables & dbt magic
- 👩‍🎓 MS in Software Engineering Systems from **Northeastern University**
- 🎓 Dual BS degrees from **University of Denver** in CS & BIA (yes, I like school a little too much)
- ☕ Powered by caffeine, curiosity, and clean code (if you couldnt already tell)

---

### 🧠 Currently geeking out over:
- ☁️ Cloud Computing (Terraform-ing my way to greatness)
- 🧠 AI Modeling (because why not teach machines to think?)
- 🔐 Backend APIs, Database Design, and building things that *just work*

---

### 🌿 Outside the code:

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me **exploring nature**, **getting artsy**, **reading a good book**, or **lifting at the gym** like the bug-fixer I am.

- ✉️ Hit me up about tech, career advice, or fun ML side projects

---

### 🦜 Fun fact:
I once had **two parrots** who were louder than most meetings. And somehow still less chaotic.  

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Tech I vibe with:

`Python` • `Java` • `SQL` • `JavaScript` • `Snowflake` • `Node.js` • `dbt` • `MongoDB` • `React` • `.NET` • `AWS` • `Terraform`

Thanks for stopping by — Code loud. Serve louder. 💅🎾
